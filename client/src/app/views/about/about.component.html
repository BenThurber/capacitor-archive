  <h1>About the site</h1>
  <p>
    Capacitor Archive is a place to upload images and historical information about vintage capacitors (originally
    called condensers) in a format similar to Wikipedia or <a href="https://www.radiomuseum.org/">Radiomuseum.org</a>.
    Capacitors are one type of electrical component found in antique radios, TVs and other electronic equipment.
  </p>

  <h2>Motivation</h2>

    <p>
      When collectors restore vintage electronics, most of the original capacitors are removed and replaced, since
      many have failed over time.  When old components are replaced with modern equivalents, some of the historical
      value and ascetic is lost.
    </p>

    <p style="font-style: italic">
      I created this website to preserve the history of these old components.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, when restoring rare radios, some collectors will create visual reproductions of the capacitors.
      This may be done by printing out paper labels, and attaching them to modern equivalents.  A feature of this
      website will be to have printouts of capacitor labels for creating reproductions.

  <p>
    I am a {{age}} year old computer science student interested in radios and old electronics, and a member of the
    <a href="https://nzvrs.com/">New Zealand Vintage Radio Society</a>.

    I have an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thurber_radios/">Instagram</a> where I like to post
    about old radios and components.

    I am fascinated by the sci-fi looking valves/vacuum tubes on the outside, and the colourful resistors and
    capacitors on the insides.
